# Please solve this question. Monica is making N food items for Joey. 
# Each of these food items has some nutritional value stored in an array V. 
# Help Monica to divide these food items into separate meals while making sure of the following points:

# Each meal should contain at least K number of food items.
# The difference between the maximum and the minimum nutritional value of food items in the meals should be at most M.
# Your task is to find and return the minimum number of meals in which Monica can divide the food items.
# If the food items cannot be divided into meals by following the above criteria, return -1.
# Input Specification:

#    Input 1: An integer value N, representing the number of food items.
#    Input 2: An integer value M, representing the maximum allowed nutritional value in a meal.
#    Input 3: An integer value K, representing the minimum number of food items required in one meal.
#    Input 4: An integer array V, representing the nutritional values of food items.
# Output Specification:

# Return the minimum number of meals in which Monica can divide the food items.
# Example 1:

#  Input 1: 3
#  Input 2: 1
#  Input 3: 1
#  Input 4: { 1, 1, 1 }
#  Output: 1
# Explanation:

# Here all 3 food items can be a single meal as 
# the difference between the maximum and minimum nutritional value of items is 0 
# while the maximum allowed difference is M = 1.

# Hence, 1 is returned as output.
# Example 2:

# Input 1: 2
# Input 2: 1
# Input 3: 2
# Input 4: { 1,4 }
# Output: -1
# Explanation:

# Here, we must put both items in one meal as 
# the number of food items is 2 and 
# the difference between the maximum and minimum allowed difference, M = 1.
# Hence, it is not possible to create a meal, so -1 is returned as output.
